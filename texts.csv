Haha green texts are always great 
I'm just working 
"I mean understandable, blue texts are so much better "
"Ok sweet, I'm back Saturday night so I could do something Sunday "
We can smoke again or something 
"Oh yeah, I totally forgot about the whole no smoking thing "
Lol are you gonna ask how long you have to wait before smoking 
Haha that's what I figured 
"Hey, how was your day"
"Honestly it was low key shitty, I got off work at 12:30 last night and had to work at 5 this morning "
Yeah 6 am and I'm still at work rn 
I took a 30 minute nap today on the floor with my dog and it was the best nap of my life
But yes Saturday is my last day 
But then I just get Sunday off and I have to go back to work next week 
I really want to go hammocking if the weathers nice 
I go to wingra or the arboretum a lot but I also like gov dodge and Nelson 
Hahaha I would love to learn all about them sometime 
:) I honestly feel like there's not much to know about me 
It was better than yesterday but low key still shitty 
"That's true, how was your day? Did you have work? "
Hahaha I mean it sounds kinda fun to me :) how do your teeth feel? 
"Haha yeah probably not, a Netflix night sounds fun though "
"It really is, I'm driving home from Oshkosh right now and then i have to pick my dad up from the airport "
"Hahahaha, have you traveled a lot? "
Ah makes sense. lol you went to a car show tonight? 
Sounds pretty fun. Yeah I'm down to hangout. I just woke up but I could later. 
I was waiting to figure out if I could get off work tomorrow but I just did 
"No, but that just means I don't have to get up early so I could hang later tonight "
Do you wanna just chill and watch a movie or something tonight? 
I kinda just wanna watch one at home but I don't know if we could do my house either 
"Haha either works for me, will he be unpacking in your basement? "
Hmmm... we could just hang out in your basement and then if your brothers down there like a lot we could go get food and like hang out in your car 
"Yeah, wanna do 8? "
Can we watch a scary movie 
Perfect :) 
What's your address? 
"Ok sweet, I'll let you know when I'm leaving "
I'm leaving right now 
I'm here 
"Well shit, I guess that just means we'll have to hang out again "
Just the worst 
Guess what 
I got off work Saturday 
Yeah she only works week days 
Yes for sure 
The only way I won't be mad is if you maroon yourself with me 
Hahaha I mean I guess it depends on where you are 
Morning :) I can bring you coffee at like 11. Is it the actually UW biochemistry building? 
"Ok, cool. I'll do my best to be there at 11 "
I'm just leaving my house so I might be there close to 11:15 
:) I'll do my best 
I think I'm maybe here 
I'm right by the agriculture engineering building 
I don't know where to park ðŸ™ƒ
I'm parking in the lot 
Hahaha I'm glad it was good 
"Yes she is, what time are we going?  And I suppose I could manage that "
"Ok sweet, who's driving and would I be able to be picked up? My house is kinda on the way to arena. "
"Jk I lied, I thought arena was in the other direction ðŸ™ƒ "
"Ok, I live far out of the way so I can always drive too "
"Ok that works for me, can I stay later at your house so I can still drink in the morning "
Ellorie said we can go to her thing at 8 if you actually do wanna go 
"Haha ok, do you wanna meet there? Or we could get dinner or something before? "
sweet :) where do you wanna go? 
Haha I'm good with whatever so you can pick
"I'm down, where is it? "
"Ok sweet, I just need to change so I could meet you at like 7:10 "
If you haven't left yet could you please bring me a sweatshirt? 
Lol thank you ðŸ˜ƒ
Haha I honestly don't care 
I'm like 2 minutes away 
Not even 
Sorry bout it 
I'm here 
I somehow made it home alive despite my lights just not working half the time 
It was honestly pretty spooky. Thank you :) it went really well 
":) lol sounds good, what place are we going to? There's one like pretty close to my moms house "
Ok I think that's the one by my house so we could always meet there or something 
If I could be picked up then no but otherwise yes ðŸ˜Š
"I think so, did you guys find weed? "
"Haha ok, what time do you think? "
Ellorie and I just got back to Madison so do you wanna link right now? 
Okay 
We are heading that way now 
"Thanks for inviting us, I'm sorry we couldn't stay later "
Me too ðŸ˜Š We really need to work on your rolling skills though 
Hahaha I should've done that 
If that would be possible I would love that but I don't know how out of the way my dads house is 
"Ok, thank you so much "
Are you going out tonight? 
I'm going out with like Ellorie and Griffin but we could try and meet up depending on where we each end up? 
Yes but idk what ones 
I'm not drinking though because I have to drive 
"Ok, I could always pick you up/take you home too if you wanted "
lol not if you're drinking 
Are you guys not going to bars then? 
"Damn, I hope you have fun though "
What albums? 
"Kinda sounds amazing, it's like chill I guess "
There's a lot of people here 
We went to Wanda's and now we're at Brats which is lame af 
Hahaha it's definitely not 
"Yeah it was just like dead, Wando's was packed but the music was bad "
Maybe some time 
I definitely have heard you sing 
"Hey, so what's the plan for this morning. Am I still being picked up? "
Yes
4685 Schneider dr 
Thank you 
Like he was asking if we talk 
"lol don't, I didn't understand at first either "
It's samee_gefke 
"Sweet, thank you"
Yeah I'm definitely down 
All of the above? 
What time? 
Haha do you wanna do like 5:30
Actually can we do 6
"Lol sweet, where do you wanna go for dinner? "
Hmmmm I really don't know 
Like I'm not in the mood for anything particular 
Hahaha yes 
"Yeah a couple times with Ellorie, I'm down to go there "
Do you wanna go back to my house after? I can't leave my dog in his crate for super long. 
"Ok cool, I'm on my way to novanta rn "
Same 
No way 
That's amazing 
Hahaha dabs really do get you that way 
I think like the 5th or 6th and then I leave in the morning on the 7th 
But then I'll be back on the 11th
Not until like the end of August but I honestly don't even know how much I'm going to be staying there 
"My parents, I have to talk to them about transferring "
"Yes I did, I think they would let me transfer if they knew why "
Like why I want to transfer 
Yeah it's closer to my barn plus most of my friends live in Madison and I just like love Madison 
Hahaha I could never forget those 
"Haha I'm honestly so proud, did you take a picture of it? "
It honestly looks pretty good
How'd it smoke? 
I guess that's always the goal 
"Hey, how has your day been?"
"Sounds fun, what kind of bread was it? I hope you have fun tonight, are you going to bars? "
"I'm sorry your mouth is swollen though, does it hurt still? "
"It's been chill, I went into town today with my cousins and then was just hanging outside with my dog"
"Hahaha, what made you wanna make bread? Ah that still sounds fun though, is it at your house? "
"Yeah, I'm trying to relax the best I can "
"Hahaha what a bummer, at least it turned out somewhat ok though. That's good, I hate hosting parties. Can you stop and get more alcohol? "
"Yeah, especially if people bring some of their own stuff too. "
I love to cook and bake but I like hate washing dishes so I rarely do it ðŸ˜‚
Haha I'm just gonna have to like force myself to do my dishes right away 
Hahaha sounds good to me
Honestly sounds kind of amazing so yes 
I haven't been drunk in so long either 
That might be too fancy for me 
Wow I'm honored 
Hahaha sounds amazing 
Guess what I did tonight 
Well obviously but it's how that's dope 
Hahaha I was smoking my bubbler on the buoy outside like the harbor our cabin in on 
You would love it up here 
I wish I got to spend more time up here this year but I'm so busy with work 
Well 2 for sure but possibly 3 depending on what my schedule is like with the other two 
"No, Milwaukee jobs. I'll keep my job at my barn though and work when I come home for breaks. "
"Yeah, I have that nanny job and then I think I might work retail or waitress "
No just Wednesday's and Friday's 
Tomorrow super early in the morning
Do you want to hang out tomorrow night 
Wanna hang at my dads house? 
Hahaha I'm gonna have to clean now though 
Haha it's mostly just my room that's dirty 
Anytime after 4 
Yeah for sure
I'm not sure what food my dad even has but I can try and make us dinner 
"Hahaha it's ok, I'll see you tomorrow "
"Depends, I don't like them if it's for something like important "
Yeah I agree 
"Hey, what time do you think you're coming? "
Yes for sure 
"It's ok, I don't mind. And don't worry about it, I didn't even know"
I was like super busy because I tweaked and woke up late 
How was your day 
Haha smooth 
I had such a shitty day today 
It was just like really long and busy 
And like I'm just a lot more depressed today than usual so that doesn't help 
"No it's ok, there's not much to do "
My friend loves those 
Kwik Trip apparently has good ones 
"Thank you, I hoe your day has been good so far "
"Interesting, you should learn "
I bet they're pretty easy to make 
Hahaha I don't like pistachios but I'll help you make them 
"No, I don't like nuts"
Hahaha obviously 
"I work Tuesday through Friday but I have to go to Milwaukee Monday, why? "
"Haha yeah I probably could, depends on when though "
"Yes, 6 to 4:30"
"Yeah it really sucks, for sure. I could maybe come over Monday on my way back from Milwaukee. "
Haha it's ok 
"Have fun but be safe, I'm going to bed tho since I work at 5 "
How was your night last night 
Hahaha sounds like an exciting night 
I literally texted you back like night and then fell asleep immediately so sorry about that 
Yes
Very 
Hahaha no I didn't today 
"I will do my best. Yes, but my dad gets home tonight so I wanna spend time with him. "
"Yes, I have to go to Milwaukee today because my roommates messed up all the measuring "
"A bed frame, desk, dresser type thing, and a night stand "
I think just pine and then a natural gloss for the finish 
"Haha ok, goodnight "
"Hahaha it really does. It was ok, I had to work super early tho "
"Haha I mean kinda, I still worked until 4 today "
What are you doing tonight? 
Do you want to smoke with Ellorie and I? 
Hahaha ok. Do you wanna join us? Ask shaurya to come
At like 9:15 
p club
Link there? 
Main 
Parked by the kids junction buses 
"I'm ok, I'm tired af though"
What about you? 
Honestly same
My sad playlist has been on all morning 
Honestly same
No I had to work all day today 
Hahaha sounds super risky plus I'm just tired af
I took like a 2 hour nap again but hopefully because I'm still tired ðŸ˜‚
What are you doing Sunday night? 
Haha I will do my best 
"Oh shoot, I was going to say we should go to dinner "
I could maybe do like a later dinner tomorrow night or possible Saturday 
Otherwise I could hang later Friday night 
What time are you moving in on Friday because that day would work best for me 
"Lol ok, wanna go to dinner somewhere? "
Lol sounds amazing to me 
Hahaha I agree 
It needs to be like $100 for a salad too 
Well obviously 
"Lol no I have not, what is it? "
I wanna hear all about it tonight 
No I don't 
What time do we wanna go to dinner tonight? 
Do you actually wanna go somewhere nice? I was thinking Fresco if you do but we would probably have to call for a reservation. 
"Oh yeah that's true, I kinda do want to go somewhere nicer though"
"Haha ok, I'm trying to think of places to go but I can't "
"Ok cool, do you have any ideas on where to go? "
I honestly don't known
*know 
I kinda want Italian or sushi 
Red is good
I would do that or vinsanto 
"Sure, do you think we'll need one? "
Are we meeting there? Or do you wanna meet at your house? 
"Ok, I'm just gonna change then and I'll be over "
I'm leaving rn 
Sorry I couldn't find clothes to wear 
I'll be there like 7:30ish 
I'm here 
"Oh good, I was worried "
I made it back too 
"Chill, we got here at like 12 so just started "
Wow I'm so proud 
Only the best 
Hahaha amazing 
I'll buy you a lamp 
Amazing 
I'm glad
No 
Ellorie and griffin don't wanna go and I'm tired 
I don't really feel all that good either 
Are you going 
Ah makes sense
Kinda 
I just have a headache and like feel kinda gross 
Yeah
I kinda want to smoke too
Can I come over 
Hahaha ok 
I'm gonna change and then I'll leave 
Is there a parking garage close 
Ok cool 
I'll be there in 15
I just parked so I'll be there soon 
Lol ok 
"I made it back, I'm sorry I just like slept the entire night "
I'm glad I got to see you before you left too... I'm going to miss you 
Haha yeah they're the nicest
Where are you exactly? 
"Oh nice, I've never been to pictured rocks but I really want to go "
"That's true, I would love to "
I'll probably start staying there on like the 1st 
Yes 
You get back Friday night right? 
I don't work at all Friday 
"Hahaha ok, do you wanna hang after? "
How was hiking today? 
I got into a huge fight with my roommates and my mom today...
"I'm sorry, was it cold? "
Yeah my roommates yelled at me for like a solid couple hours about it 
Ah makes sense 
Yes 
It was about getting a car 
Like she gave me all these fucking rules like I'm 12 years old 
Yeah I guess so 
My dads going to help me some but I feel bad asking him to do that 
Do you have plans Sunday? 
"That's ok, idk she's just being ridiculous. I tried to like compromise and she literally won't"
"Wanna go to Milwaukee with Ellorie, Griffin, and I? "
Not late 
Like we'd go for the morning/afternoon 
I can
Aw yay 
Wow I'm honestly proud 
Furthest I've done was like 15 miles and that was too much 
That should be my new car 
Perfect for me 
What time are you going to be back? 
Are you gonna be super tired or do you wanna hang still? 
Sorry I was sleeping on my couch
Do you have plans tomorrow night? I really want to see you but I'm so tired rn 
I'm sorry 
I'm just so tired 
Tonight? 
Maybe like 6 or 7? 
"Haha it's all good, I just had to figure out my schedule for the day "
I'd be down to get food 
Do you wanna go with me to get sheets and a comforter for my bed at school 
Do you want me to just scoop you from your apartment 
Like 6ish probably
I'll let you know when I'm leaving 
I'm currently waiting for my laundry to be done 
I'm leaving now so I'll be there in 15-20
Is there a lot I can pull into 
Ok sweet 
I'm here 
Haha I'll come back tomorrow 
I work Monday but otherwise no 
Yay
Does that mean you're gonna make me dinner soon 
Hahaha sweet
I'm going to pick Ellorie and Griffin up at 9 tomorrow downtown 
Of course :) 
Does 9 work for you too 
Ok sweet
I think we're just gonna hang and hammock some 
Are you going out tonight 
Maybe some swimming but idk how hot it's going to be 
Haha it's ok 
Not to bars but Ellorie is having like a kickback at her apartment that I might go to 
Are you too drunk or just tired? 
Hahaha nice 
Idk if I wanna go to Ellorie's 
What time late 
*later 
Sorry I fell asleep 
I didn't end up going to Ellorie's 
I'm gonna be there closer to 9:30 and Ellorie and Griffin are meeting you at La Ciel 
I'm here 
Ok
Haha ok
I'm not even home yet either 
I'm just getting in the shower and then I'll come 
Obviously 
Can I come soon? 
Ok sweet 
I'll be there in 15
I'm here 
Hahaha if you would like to go I would 
I've never been to a circus 
What days is it? 
Because I kinda want to go 
We should go 
"I could Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday "
Yeah
Yeah that works 
Yay 
When do you work this week 
Ok
Today is my last day 
I have a retreat thing for my sorority Saturday and Sunday but I don't think I'm going back to Milwaukee until Monday or Tuesday 
Yeah... unless I don't have all my stuff together which is pretty likely 
Do you have plans tonight? 
Yeah 
Wanna walk to the union or something like that though 
I would go somewhere for dinner too 
Haha ok
I'll leave soon 
Would you wanna link with Ellorie and smoke too 
"lol ok, I'm leaving rn so I'll be there in 15-20"
I'm here 
Yeah I remembered right as I got home 
Like what? 
Hahaha ok 
That's fair I guess 
Haha sounds amazing 
"It was good, I just got back "
Do you still wanna go get pie?
"Fuck, are there any other good pie places? "
I have to wait for my dad to get home so I can take his car 
Well crap 
I'll call him and see if I can take our truck 
He's gonna be home in 10 minutes so I can leave right away and we can go 
I'm leaving right now 
I'm here 
I got stuck trying to fill out a rental application so I can't bring you coffee before I go to my barn. I could bring some after but it wouldn't be until like 12:30. 
Hahaha I'll bring some when I come to pick you up 
5:15? 
"Haha yeah I'm down, I can pick you up later too if you don't wanna be super early "
Lol yeah 
Do you want me to stop and get coffee on my way? 
"I'm good with whatever, I'm just ready early for once ðŸ™ƒ"
Hahaha ok
I'm leaving right now but I'm stopping to get food for my children quick so I'll be there like 5:30 still  
I'm here 
You're literally so sweet... how are you this morning? Do you want me to bring you coffee? 
"No, I don't have to go anymore "
I can bring you coffee at like 10:15 though if that works? 
Loved an image
Adorable 
I'm almost there 
I'm here 
Loved an image
That's a cuter picture 
We looked photoshopped in tho ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Hahaha I'm looking forward to seeing the final 
That ones the best 
We don't look as photoshopped in 
Haha I would've taken one of you guys 
It's like the only photo we actually have together 
Me too 
I know you work tomorrow but do you want to go out with Ellorie and I tonight? We could make it a somewhat early night too because Ellorie works tomorrow too 
"No, that's ok. Are you guys going to bars? "
"No, I can't. I'm hanging with my dad and I have to be in Milwaukee really early Saturday. "
"Yeah, can I possibly stay with you? I feel like I would sleep better"
"Sweet, thank you. What time are you going to try and be back? "
"No, it's up to you since you have work tomorrow "
"Ok, just let me know "
I just got to Ellorie's so I'm pregaming super quick 
Where are you going now 
Are you here?
We're at Jacob dillies too 
Like the delta chi one? 
Well shit 
Where are you rn then 
Because we're in the party rn 
okay 
Katie ditched us 
Idk another party 
"It's ok, I kinda want to leave "
Eh just not in the mood 
I think we're going to nitty 
Did they scan your i don't 
Because mine doesn't scan 
Has anywhere else been getting raided 
Well damn 
"Ok, we're gonna drink a little more and then maybe go to a bar "
Are you going to want to go to bed right away? 
No 
I want food 
Ellorie's apartment
I might come rn 
Yes 
Can Ellorie and Griffin come for a bit to smoke a little or drink 
Hahaha ok 
We're waiting for griffin too 
He just got here 
"Ok, Ellorie's making me food and then we can come over "
I'm still at Ellorie's 
We'll come once you're back 
Yes 
Rn 
We were cleaning up 
It's not working 
Ok 
"Hahaha I would've just been like ""I'm actually dead but thank you"" "
Were you hungover or just tired 
"No, I'm just really tired "
Yes we do
Do you have classes on Tuesday? 
"Yeah, or I was gonna ask if you potentially wanted to go to Milwaukee with me and like hammock and I could move some stuff. And then you could stay over and we could come back Tuesday "
"I'm not sure, I'm waiting to see when my landlord is available to have me sign my lease and get my keys "
I just want to spend time with you before school starts 
If you didn't come Monday with me I would leave like Monday night because I have to work for an hour or two Tuesday morning
Wednesday 
I work at 8 am Tuesday but I shouldn't be more than like 30-45 minutes because I'm just taking him to school and meeting his teachers 
"Yeah it you wouldn't mind doing that, otherwise we can just hang Monday in Madison "
I would love it if you came to Milwaukee with me :) 
Yay :) we can go whenever because my roommate gave me keys 
Hahaha ok 
lol maybe a little later so we don't hit rush hour 
Do you wanna get breakfast first? 
Sure! I might have to bring Arlo if you're cool with that too 
"Yeah, I'm going to see if my dad can watch him but I don't know if he can "
It's ok 
I'm in like a sad af mood rn tho 
Idk I'm just like sad tbh 
It's like nothing new 
I mean yes but I like don't know how to express why I'm sad because I don't even know 
I'm sorry... you can go first 
"I'm sorry, what happened with your friend? And I know, I'm so sad and anxious about me going back to Milwaukee too. I've obviously never done the long distance thing either and it just worries me because I already miss you so much and it's been like two days... Why are you scared though? And like not ready for school stuff or not ready for us? "
More than ik with you? 
Yeah I guess I understand that... 
I feel like we really need to talk about this in person though because there's a lot of stuff I would rather tell you in person 
"Sorry I fell asleep, I just really care about you and I feel like it's better we talk in person. I can probably come over later tonight if you want. "
"I'm not really sure, I work at 3:30 and I feel like I'll be there for like 2 hours so that puts me back at 7ish. "
"Ok, I'm leaving Milwaukee right now so just let me know I guess "
Are you going to church? 
Yeah I'll come over for a little if you want me too
*to
I'm like almost to Madison though 
"Ok, I'll be there in like 15-20 then "
I just parked 
I got let in so I'll be up in a second 
Lol that's good 
"Morning, does like 11:30/11:45 work for me to come pick you up? "
I'm actually ready a lot earlier than I thought so I can leave whenever you're ready 
I'm leaving right now
I want to go to ikea at some point today 
I'm here 
My mom's address is 1328 n 58th st btw
Yeah I'm leaving rn 
Wanna go to Ellorie's with me for a while 
I can't stay super late though 
I would love it since I'm not coming back till Monday now but I understand if you're tired 
I'm at Ellorie's rn so come whenever 
I'm probably not gonna stay super long but I wanted to see her 
Yeah it's just the two of us 
Are you gonna be up for a while? 
Because I'm not gonna stay super late here so I can stop by when I'm leaving 
Just come here for a while 
Are you here? 
:) sleep well 
Hahaha that's actually low key funny 
You can make friends with some wholesome little freshman kids 
"Haha I bet, they're fine. I haven't checked stuff today yet "
"No, I usually just stay at home so I can chill with Arlo and Finn "
"Oh for sure, can we also go to a movie "
There were a couple movies out that I wanted to see so I'm up for anything 
Sounds amazing 
Haha I'm like trying to go for a run rn but my phone is almost dead ðŸ™ƒ
Honestly that sounds pretty great 
I didn't end up going 
Haha ok
We can take Arlo 
Naw not really 
Hahahaha works for me 
"Aw I'm sorry, I wish I could help but I can't speak Spanish for shy "
*shit 
I literally drove all over looking for plants because I have a problem ðŸ™ƒ I bought like 5 for my room 
"No, I'm propagating mine though because I wanna try and save them "
"Yeah I had to save them because they didn't get enough sun this summer... it's ok, I had to get a bigger one so I put that in the glass thing we got "
I think you should do both 
I'll help you 
You can! I was gonna make one with a koi fish
We can tonight 
Depends on where you want to put it and what you want to put in the terrarium 
"Maybe then, you could just get like one of the grow light bulbs because a fish wouldn't want to be under a really intense grow light "
There's some plants though that really don't need much light 
We can go to my favorite plant store when I'm back 
I'm working on stuff rn but it's ok... can we FaceTime tonight soon? 
We can FaceTime while I'm doing it too if you want 
Ok :) 
"That's ok, I understand. I'll talk to you tomorrow :) I'm glad we got to FaceTime tonight"
Wow I'm proud of you 
Hahaha I'm sorry 
That's low key really funny tho 
Haha I'm looking forward to it 
Awww thank you 
Well shit... how do you even fuck up that bad 
Like I don't know jack shit about computers but I feel like I could still manage to not screw it up that bad 
Is it fixable though? 
Yeah that should be fun... at least it wasn't you who did it 
I had a wild ass day at work too 
There was an electrical fire at the kids house 
I can't hear you 
But yeah everyone was fine 
It still ain't working 
Can you FaceTime me because I'm eating 
I really enjoyed getting to talk to you tonight even though I was tired... I'm going to bed but I hope you have a fun night tonight and I can't wait to hear about it tomorrow 
"You're goofy but also very sweet, I'm guessing you had a fun night?"
"Haha it's ok, how was it? "
Well damn... I sometimes like chill vibes though 
Lol yeah I bet 
Of course :) I'm glad I got to talk to you 
"It was busy but fun, what about you? "
"That sounds amazing, can we go tomorrow? "
I should've done that but I didn't 
I'll bring a blanket :) 
Fuck I'm pretty sure I have recruitment this weekend 
Otherwise I would 
I'll help you clean Monday 
I can :) 
Probably will because idk if my car will be done 
Yes please 
"Aw I'm sorry, do you want to talk more about it? "
Is it Hannah or the other person? 
I'm sorry 
I wish I could help but I don't really know exactly what happened 
I feel like everything will work out though if she really is your best friend 
"I understand that, I'm here for you though if you do ever want to talk about it... It was chill, I like went shopping and ran some errands and then I had my first riding team meeting "
I'll be riding the horses at their barn and for shows I guess I show like a random horse 
":) I'm really excited too, it's going to be a lot different from what I'm used to but I'm still super excited to be able to ride "
Hahaha you will definitely have to come to one of the shows 
It hasn't been started yet ðŸ™ƒ
Lol yeah I'm home but I guess my dad had an appointment in the morning so he just got back 
"Yeah hopefully, probably not today but we'll have tomorrow morning to do it too "
We're done working on it for today so I can hang whenever 
I would be down to come chill with you while you work on homework as long as you'll still be able to get stuff done 
"Hahaha ok, no I did it all yesterday "
"I'm leaving rn, sorry I was talking to my dad "
Im here 
"Ah ok, that's good"
And that's sweet 
Yeah I bet 
"Hahaha no problem, honestly every single Lumineers song is amazing "
"tbh I don't really know, my sister just got home so I'm gonna check with her in a second about dinner. I have to run an errand quick and then I'll be back home. If we do dinner it would probably be at like 6:30 and then we could go to a movie or hang. "
"I will for sure, I'll be home in 15 so I'll know soon "
"I mean you don't have to like dress up dress up but I would dress nicer, I'll probably wear like a casual overall dress type thing "
"Honestly whatever you think looks nice, we're going to delux "
Does 7 work? 
"Ok sweet, probably like 6:50 unless you wanna walk? "
Yes unless you wanna drive 
Yeah I'm down to walk 
I'm just gonna have to scoop you because we're running late 
"I'm leaving rn, let's just walk and we'll meet them there a little late "
Actually do we still wanna go to a movie? Because we could just go straight from dinner which means we should drive there 
Yes but her and griffin could come? 
We're walking 
I don't wanna drive 
I'm here 
What
Oh lol 
When do you wanna leave 
I'm tired 
"The bigger one looks better now, like all the fuzz is gone. I'm wondering if it didn't like the wet paper towel "
"Hahaha its ok, I'll send updates "
Yeah of course
"Idk it was a little weird, I didn't know that his roommates would be like hanging with us "
"Yeah I know, I'm actually sad "
We never went to the plant store either 
We really do 
Frankiehearn 
By the way I'm done with work at like 7ish so I can talk anytime after that 
Sounds good :) 
I'm taking my friend home from class but I should be back home by like 8:45 
That's if you still do wanna talk 
Ok :) I'll probably be up somewhat late because I'm gonna smoke and possibly attempt to remove more color from my hair 
"No, it's just gonna be me and Finn "
I can wait to smoke too till after 
For sure 
"Morning, it was chill. I just ate and then I was planning on watching Netflix but I fell asleep after like 10 minutes "
Hahaha sounds like it 
That doesn't sound good 
"Haha ok, what did you even do "
Jesus... it's probably like stuck in there 
You just need like a Bobby pin or one of those little zit tools 
And a pointed tweezer 
I guess that's close enough 
"Lol I look forward to hearing updates, put Neosporin on it too because you don't want it getting infected  "
Wow that's so wholesome 
That's good 
Wow that's hot 
Ommm can you FaceTime me so I can explain it 
Beautiful 
What's under it? Just the devils backbone? 
I'm glad you found your lighter 
Probably like 10 am-6 pm for now 
Wow I'm proud 
I wanna see a picture 
That looks cool 
You should edit it
Hahaha happy spooky day to you too 
I have no clue
I can't go out 
"Oh no, we're wholesome over here "
Literally us 
Yay! Yeah that work
I think like the way top of my leg right below my hip 
These are the ones I like 
I like the balloon too because of it 
Hahaha ok
Do you like the Illuminati symbol 
I like the bat too 
Hmmm 
I'm kinda thinking the bat but idk 
I wanna look closer at them 
Like a while 
Yes 
I like the tooth now too 
All the way on the left 
Yeah it's hard to see 
lol I don't really have a reason for any of them except the balloon 
lol I don't really have a reason for any of them except the balloon 
Where would you put the other two? I can do arms or legs but I don't really want to do my arms 
I honestly don't know 
I like the loser/lover one too because that's from IT too 
Yeah 
Yeah but I don't know 
Would the Illuminati one look ok if I put it like more over on my hip 
Ok I think I'm getting that 
Do I get the IT balloon 
That's what I'm leaning towards 
But do I get it on my hip or on my other ankle 
Like right where the other one is but on my other leg 
Yeah I agree 
Fuck I don't know 
I could get the Illuminati like on my ankle but lower down 
Jk I'm getting the little alien tattoo with the space ship 
Like on the inside of my ankle but lower 
Like the inside on my ankle but low 
Hopefully that's cute because I finally decided 
The spaceship thing with little guy 
I wish 
That'd be so dope 
I can add it later 
Should be soon 
Hopefully 
We've been in line for like 3 hours 
Two of the girls from my sorority and one of their friends 
Yes 
I will show you when I take the bandage off! 
I think you should 
What plants? 
Sweet! Did you get pots and soil? 
A little but not horrible 
Just like general potting soil should be ok because the only time you really need special stuff is for succulents and orchids 
"Yeah it's cute, he kinda fucked up in one spot but I might get it filled with UV ink at some point "
"And I like terra cotta pots because they're the cheapest and are good, just don't get plastic ones because those are bad for the environment. "
Tonight at 5 
Yeah it's really cute it's just low key shitty but I wanna get it filled 
Like when I go get my other alien I wanna do that 
"Probably like the beam part, not like the actual UFO "
Yeah the girl who did my cat is opening her books soon so I'm gonna email her about them all 
Wow pretty much 
Next tattoo? 
"Idk hopefully soonish, she's opening her books at the end of the month so hopefully I'll be able to get for December/January "
You should 
Guess what 
I'm coming home Monday again 
I gotta finish my bed and pick up Arlo 
Yes we should 
No probably Tuesday morning
"I can try, I might have to stay with Arlo tho "
Yes we do 
And plant store 
Yeah that's true
Yes 
Did you finish IT 
You should
Yay 
Or we can go see another movie 
Oh don't do that 
We can go to a different movie 
Oh of course
Are you going out tonight because I wanna FaceTime 
Amazing 
I'm smoking tonight when I get home 
That's fine 
I just wanna talk to you 
No 
Sorry I'm just like in my feels and I miss you 
Everything is fine though
Ok I'll be back at like 12 
But if you have people over we can wait 
Probably fairly late 
I'm gonna smoke and watch tv and maybe draw some 
Ok cool 
Damn I'm probably going to bed soon 
Really? I'm sorry 
"Yeah, I think I'm gonna go to bed because I'm tired as shit "
What did she say? 
"I'm sorry, I feel like you're just being paranoid "
Lol goodnight :) I can't wait to see you Monday too but I'll talk to you tomorrow 
Yeah we can FaceTime while I'm getting ready and it's ok
"At like 10, I just have to shower rn tho and run to Walgreens "
Twins 
I'm back 
Whenever you are 
I downloaded duo 
Yes we do 
Yeah for a little bit 
"Hey, sorry my friend was really drunk and I had to pick her up from a party. I really enjoyed talking to you and will probably be up for a little bit if you want to FaceTime. I understand if you wanna enjoy your party though so if not we can FaceTime tomorrow or something. "
Let me just grab food quick 
I can whenever 
How'd you sleep 
Damn I'm sorry 
I crashed and slept through my alarm this morning 
No luckily Finn woke me up 
"I will talk to her, I doubt she's pissed tho. I mean it's hard because you're friend with her but like she also came super late. "
Yay!!!!
I'm so pumped 
Yeah that makes sense 
Like it'd be different if it was just Ellorie and griffin 
I honestly doubt she's mad tho 
I would just apologize 
"It's chill, we were done at like 1:30 so we've just been waiting around "
No tomorrow 
Yeah we aren't gonna be done will 11 and I don't wanna drive back so late 
"No, we're just like waiting around for bid day "
But we're technically on a long ass break rn 
"Lol no, I didn't have any to do so I just napped "
Yeah it was nice 
We don't know yet actually 
Like we don't even know who the new members are 
Us kinda but it's super complicated so I'll explain it a different time 
We just found out what the list is tho 
Naw man 
Haha close
I met a really cool girl today tho
Me but cooler 
Yes 
She's so cool 
Yes 
Wait no but it's her first year at Uwm
Yeah 
Lol more of a I wanna be her crush but yeah 
Hahaha sure 
Do you wanna FaceTime in a bit? 
Ok just call me whenever 
"Good morning, how'd you sleep? "
That's so early 
I'm glad you got stuff done though 
That's good 
I'm tired af 
lol I am actually 
I just finished it so I'm hopefully leaving for Madison by 11:30 but we'll see what happened 
Wow sounds like an eventful day already 
That's good! 
I got officially signed up for the riding team 
I'm going to ride Thursday and then we have our first show the 27-29
It in Madison actually too if you're interested in coming 
Hahaha please don't 
I won't talk to you if you have a sign 
I like honestly don't even know what to expect tho 
Hahaha you're not wrong 
Oh I'm looking forward to seeing it 
Wow I'm impressed
Thanks for sharing 
That sounds gross 
That'd be hot 
You'd probably make the local news 
Hahaha it really does 
It should be
"It's going well tho, we finished priming it and we're switching tires now"
"I haven't driven it yet, I'm bringing it tonight tho "
Probably like 8:30ish or maybe 9 
We're having trouble with my Jeep and I need to shower after that 
"However late you want me to, I'm not sure what time you have class tomorrow "
"Ok, I can stay late then "
I'm showering rn and then I just have to change and stop for gas 
Can I leave rn? 
Ok sweet I'll see you in a sec 
I also kinda want to go to target if you're interested 
"Ok, I'm gonna wait to go to the gas station then so I'll be there in like 15 "
I just parked so I'll be there in a second 
"It's ok, I'm sorry I'm being confusing too. We can talk more tomorrow. Goodnight "
Why didn't you just say that? 
Oh ok...
Being with you is more important than all of that stuff. Like I thought it was important to me but I like you so much that it doesn't even matter. Like I thought I did something wrong and then I had a panic attack and just like shut down. 
"I'm sorry, I literally just want to spend time with you and I don't care at all what we do. Some of my favorite memories together have been when we've just gone and done stuff together. I thought that sex meant a lot to me in a relationship but it just doesn't anymore. Like meeting you made me realize that I want more than that."
Honestly just meeting you and like seeing how to treat me 
You treat me with such kindness and understanding and I'm sorry that I low key fuck shit up sometimes. I'm really thankful I have you in my life though. 
You'll just have to wait till this weekend 
Hahaha we'll have to see what we can find for $15 
Yeah let me look 
"It was chill, work was boring af but it's whatever "
I had to cancel riding tomorrow which sucks but I get to ride after I drop you off on Sunday now 
My dad is coming 
"I bet that's amazing, I wish I was there"
That's fucking amazing 
I wish I was that cool 
Wow... there's no way I'm going up there but I'll definitely watch 
Lol I can't sing 
Fuck I thought I responded to this last night 
Turns out I was just high af and tweaked 
How has your day been though? 
That's good 
"Ommm like something to wear out Friday night if you wanna do that, clothes for during the day Saturday, something nicer for dinner Saturday night, clothes for if you wanted to go out Saturday night too but I kinda don't want to as of right now, and then clothes for Sunday "
And like whatever clothes you wanna wear to bed 
Haha yeah 
Oh lol I just woke up ðŸ™ƒ like dressy but you don't need to wear a suit or anything that fancy 
"Hmmm idk, I'm probably going to wear a dress but it's not super fancy by any means "
Haha ok 
"I was super tired, my dad came and helped me build my bed and then I took a fat ass nap "
I mean I slept from like 3-6:30
Yes
I'm so excited 
And what would those be
Hahaha that's very vague 
Hmmm I honestly don't know 
Please don't 
I would like you to continue 
"Oh yes, the finest wining and dining around "
You're sweet 
I wanna go to bars with you too 
"All the times I've gone out I've just been like ""I wish Gage was here"" "
I'm sorry
Yeah 
I want you to be having fun 
Ok good 
Yes 
Hahaha yeah 
I gotta grab my computer tho because my phones gonna die 
One sec
Call me when you can 
"Morning, I'm glad you finished packing "
Finn and Arlo actually let me sleep in today and I'm so fucking happy 
Such juxtaposition in one text  
Hahaha I'm excited too 
My boss says she thinks she'll be home at like 7:30 so I can be there at 7:45ish
Hahaha good luck 
Where is it that I'm picking you up 
I thought I knew but I was incorrect 
Ok apparently I'm tweaking because that is where I thought 
That's not fair 
I technically know exactly how to get there I've just never picked anyone up from taking a bus before 
Damn I'm sorry 
That is so fucking dope 
I'm not surprised it was cheaper 
"Hahaha sounds amazing, I feel like a lot of bus drivers just wip like crazy "
Yeah like vegan leather is a lot more expensive 
Yeah I think it does 
When's it supposed to be there 
"Lol, it's should be on time "
I never have either 
Ew that's gross af 
Haha that's good 
My boss will be home in 10 minutes so I'll be there a little before 8 
I'm here 
I like just woke up 
If you wanna wait a sec I'd come 
Oh ok 
Can you please get me an iced chai 
"Thank you, what place is it? I'll look it up "
Oh cool
I'll look 
I can't find a menu but I'm good
"Ok, thank you though "
Yes please 
Hahaha honestly it's ok
Lol I'm actually gonna do that 
FYI this is my aunts insta page for her plants so don't ever tell me I have too many 
https://instagram.com/plantgrowandnurture?igshid=5hmlbfrdqhqm
I literally love them so fucking much 
I don't know because as of right now idk if I can even go 
Can I FaceTime you and explain 
Yes 
It's just a lot to explain and it's stressing me out so I wanna talk to you about it 
Ok cool 
Thank you 
What's up 
Hahaha yeah that's fine 
Hahaha that's good 
I'm glad you're STD free 
"Yeah, I got to switch days so I'm going to the show now "
I think I'll probably ride in the morning if you're still interested in coming 
Saturday and Sunday 
"No, I'm not really positive but sometime in the early afternoon/afternoon "
"Yay, I will try but I don't really know the actual schedule "
Yeah for sure! 
What are you doing today 
Can you send me pictures of that one plant? And yay! What did you get? 
I went to lunch earlier with my friend and then I had an advising appointment and then I have work at 3 
"That's good, I can help you pot them if you want... it went well, he didn't really know shit tho "
Essentially I'm just gonna email the UW advising office and see what they have to say 
Hopefully my GPA is good enough but I'm not confident 
"Yeah hopefully, my GPA dropped a lot since high school tho "
Tonight while I'm at work 
"Yeah I hope so, I gotta do my research tonight too but I wanna try and apply as early as possible so my chances are greater"
Yeah that's true but I think I decided on a major finally and we don't have it here 
I haven't talked to them 
Sophmore 
I'm at 24 credits exactly not including the ones from this semester 
Yeah like sophomores get more priority
"Ah ok, I honestly have no clue so I gotta talk to the admissions person "
"No, I have to stay with the team "
But I'm coming home Monday to get Arlo and Finn so maybe we could get lunch or something 
"I wish, I'm like not allowed to leave though so I would love it if you came. I think my dad and maybe my mom are coming too so you wouldn't be completely alone ðŸ˜ƒ "
We could finally go to that rock shop too 
I just have to be back in MKE by 5
Haha I'm sorry 
He will literally love to talk about hiking with you :) also ask him about his trip to Iceland! 
"Ok sweet, we could do lunch during your break "
Hahaha my dad likes you already though so I'm sure he'll be excited to talk to you about hiking/backpacking 
Really! It was actually pretty good I'm not gonna lie 
Lol im glad 
Are you around tonight? 
Do you wanna FaceTime 
Yay :) 
Yes
I'm just smoking rn 
I'm back 
Accurate 
Morning :) I just woke up and then I have work at 2
Fucking jerks 
What'd they say to her 
That's so fucking rude 
"I'm sorry, I'm sure you'll do great on your test "
